# Usage
To use this "snippet", copy the code (main.py). You can copy or leave alone the print command, You will copy this command later in this "tutorial".<br>
**Now copy this print and adjust it to you own conditions.**

```python
print(basiclog("This is title", "There goes descirption", "GRN"))
```

Where you see **"GRN"** you can change log title color to **"RED"** or **"YEL"** You can also change it to **"none"**.
